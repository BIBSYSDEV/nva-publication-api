Feature: Mappings that hold for all types of Cristin Results

  Background:
    Given a valid Cristin Result

  Scenario: Cristin entry id is saved as additional identifier
    Given the Cristin Result has id equal to 12345
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "Cristin" and value 12345

  Scenario: NVA Resource gets as Main Title the single Cristin title which is annotated as
  "Original Title" (i.e., the Cristin entry has no more titles except for the original title).
    Given the Cristin Result has an non null array of CristinTitles
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text         | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is some title | This is the original abstract | J               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is some title"

  Scenario: NVA Resource gets as Main Title the only Cristin title annotated as Original Title when
  there are many titles but only one annotated as Original.
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                 | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is the original title | This is the original abstract | J               | en            |
      | This is translated title   | This is some other abstract   | N               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is the original title"

  Scenario: NVA Resource get as Main Title being any Cristin Title annotated as
  Original Title when there are two titles both annotated as Original.
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                     | Abstract Text                     | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is the original title     | This is the original abstract     | J               | en            |
      | This is another original title | This is another original abstract | J               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is the original title"


  Scenario Outline: The language of the entry is set as Lexvo URI equivalent of the
  Cristin language code of the title annotated as ORIGINAL
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                 | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code       |
      | This is the original title | This is the original abstract | J               | <OriginalTitleCode> |
      | This is some other title   | This is some other abstract   | N               | ru                  |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with language "<NvaLanguage>"
    Examples:
      | OriginalTitleCode | NvaLanguage                      |
      | en                | http://lexvo.org/id/iso639-3/eng |
