Feature: Mappings that hold for all types of Cristin Results

  Background:
    Given a valid Cristin Result

  Scenario: Cristin entry id is saved as additional identifier
    Given the Cristin Result has id equal to 12345
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "cristin@sikt" and value 12345

  Scenario: Cristin sources are saved as additional identifiers
    Given the Cristin Result has id equal to 12345
    And the Cristin Result has a non null array of CristinSources with values:
      | Source Code Text | Source Identifier Text |
      | SomeCode         | Some identifier        |
      | Some other code  | Some other identifier  |
      | SCOPUS           | Some third identifier  |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "SomeCode" and value "Some identifier"
    And the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "cristin@sikt" and value 12345
    And the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "Some other code" and value "Some other identifier"
    And the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "Scopus" and value "Some third identifier"

  Scenario: CristinSource collides with sourceCode
    Given the Cristin Result has id equal to 12345
    And the Cristin Result has sourceCode equal to "SomeCode"
    And the Cristin Result has sourceRecordIdentifier equal to "Some other identifier"
    And the Cristin Result has a non null array of CristinSources with values:
      | Source Code Text | Source Identifier Text |
      | SomeCode         | Some identifier        |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "SomeCode" and value "Some identifier"
    And the NVA Resource has an additional identifier with key "cristin@sikt" and value 12345
    And the NVA Resource does not have an additional identifier with key "SomeCode" and value "Some other identifier"

  Scenario: NVA Resource gets the single Cristin title which is annotated as
  "Original Title" as Main Title. (i.e., the Cristin entry has no more titles except for the original title).
    Given the Cristin Result has an non null array of CristinTitles
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text         | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is some title | This is the original abstract | J               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is some title"

  Scenario: When there are many titles but only one annotated as Original,
  the NVA Resource gets the Cristin title annotated as Original Title as Main Title.
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                 | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is the original title | This is the original abstract | J               | en            |
      | This is translated title   | This is some other abstract   | N               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is the original title"

  Scenario: When there are two titles both annotated as Original the NVA Resource gets any
  of the Cristin Titles annotated as Original Title as Main Title.
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                     | Abstract Text                     | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is the original title     | This is the original abstract     | J               | en            |
      | This is another original title | This is another original abstract | J               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is the original title"

  Scenario: When there is only one title present but not annotated as Original the NVA Resource gets the Cristin Title as Main Title.
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text         | Abstract Text         | Status Original | Language Code |
      | This is some title | This is some abstract | N               | en            |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with mainTitle "This is some title"


  Scenario Outline: The language of the entry is set as Lexvo URI equivalent of the
  Cristin language code of the title annotated as ORIGINAL
    Given the Cristin Result has an array of CristinTitles with values:
      | Title Text                 | Abstract Text                 | Status Original | Language Code       |
      | This is the original title | This is the original abstract | J               | <OriginalTitleCode> |
      | This is some other title   | This is some other abstract   | N               | ru                  |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource has an EntityDescription with language "<NvaLanguage>"

    Given that Cristin Result has eierkode_opprett "FHI"
    And the Cristin Result has vitenskapeligarbeid_lokal:
      | eierkode | institusjonsnr | avdnr | undavdnr | gruppenr |

    Given that Cristin Result has eierkode_opprett "NTNU"
    And the cristin has institusjonsnr_opprettet equal to "34502", and avdnr, undavdnr and gruppenr equal to "0"
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have a owner "ntnu@34502.0.0.0" and ownerAffiliation: "https://api.test.nva.aws.unit.no/cristin/organization/34502.0.0.0"

  Scenario: When eierkode_opprettet is used as resourceOwner if vitenskapeligarbeid_lokal is a empty list.

    Then the NVA Resource should have a owner "ntnu@34502.0.0.0" and ownerAffiliation: "https://api.test.nva.aws.unit.no/cristin/organization/34502.0.0.0"

  Scenario Outline: if eierkode_opprettet is certain codes, then fallback Sikt owner should be applied.
    Given that Cristin Result has eierkode_opprett "<eierkode_opprettet>"
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have a owner "sikt@20754.0.0.0" and ownerAffiliation: "https://api.test.nva.aws.unit.no/cristin/organization/20754.0.0.0"
    Examples:
      | eierkode_opprettet |
      | CRIS               |
      | UNIT               |

  Scenario: if neither eierkode_opprettet nor vitenskapeligarbeid_lokal can be used as resource owner, then Sikt is used as owner
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have a owner "sikt@20754.0.0.0" and ownerAffiliation: "https://api.test.nva.aws.unit.no/cristin/organization/20754.0.0.0"

  Scenario: when vitenskapeligarbeid_lokal with eierkode equal to certain codes should be skipped
    Given the Cristin Result has vitenskapeligarbeid_lokal:
      | eierkode | institusjonsnr | avdnr | undavdnr | gruppenr |
      | CRIS     | 1235           | 0     | 0        | 0        |

      | NTNU     | 34502          | 0     | 0        | 0        |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have a owner "ntnu@34502.0.0.0" and ownerAffiliation: "https://api.test.nva.aws.unit.no/cristin/organization/34502.0.0.0"

  Scenario: when brage-archive handle is present they should be mapped
    Given the Cristin Result has the following varbeid_url present:
      | urltypekode | url                                  |
      | FULLTEKST   | wwww.example.com                     |
      | ARKIV       | https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2977385 |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have the archive handle set to "https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2977385"

  Scenario: when brage-archive handles is not present the result is still mapped
    Given the Cristin Result has the following varbeid_url present:
      | urltypekode | url              |
      | FULLTEKST   | wwww.example.com |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA Resource should have the handle set to null

  Scenario: when brage-archive is set to non-url, import without brage-archive
    Given the Cristin Result has the following varbeid_url present:
      | urltypekode | url                       |
      | ARKIV       | Voyage Television, France |
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA resource is imported without handle.

  Scenario: Cristin notes should be mapped to NVA notes
    Given a valid Cristin Result
    And the cristin result has a note equal to "Dette er ikke en merknad, men en artikkel 5/3-18 SH"
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA resource has a notes field equal to "Dette er ikke en merknad, men en artikkel 5/3-18 SH"

  Scenario: Cristin result without notes should be mapped to empty list
    Given a valid Cristin Result
    And the cristin result has a note equal to ""
    When the Cristin Result is converted to an NVA Resource
    Then the NVA resource has a empty list as publicationNotes
