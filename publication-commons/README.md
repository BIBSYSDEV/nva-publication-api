# publication-commons

A collection of shared classes used in more-than-one module.

Includes persistence models for entities in publication-api (Resource, Ticket, IdEntry, ImportCandidate, LogEntry, Message).

## Notes

Because of its size, the Publication model is not included here, but in [publication-model](../publication-model/README.md).
